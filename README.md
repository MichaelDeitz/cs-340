How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

1.For this one we made sure to use a oop approach.Which inreturn used the 4 behaviors.WHich we were able to write testible code and call all the errors for test conditions.I always make sure to use a modular ideal when im trying to maintain the readability and maintainabilty of a program.We want to make sure the we can tweak and fix each code thsat we are inporting.This is why we will use funtions , classes, and main.We want to make sure everything is organized.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

2.When starting on a new peoject i always will try to make sure i start with the bigger picture of what should be bult.Finding out each requirment that is needed.This way before i start writing the code i know what is being asked.This way once i start coding i dont have to go back or re start over for something i dont know.Also we used dash with python for view.ALso used pymongo for the controler.



What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

3. Wo when creating a full stack application for the company and taking accountability for the security.this was we are making sure to optmize the speed and size of a data base.We then can make sure to create the best posbility for a database. this way we can give a big database for the company in return let the company achive its goals.
